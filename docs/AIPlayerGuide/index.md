# AI Player Guide

This guide explains how to implement your own AI player for the game.

The [AI Player Example](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Project-L/tree/master/ProjectL-CLI/AIPlayerExample) project showcases the implementation of a simple AI player. You can find the documentation for it [here](../AIPlayerExampleDocs/).

The [AI Player Simulation](https://github.com/Couleslaw/Project-L/tree/master/ProjectL-CLI/AIPlayerSimulation) project is a simple CLI app you can use as a starting point for testing your AI player.
